Many reddit users are highly engaged in the defense of Internet privacy, net neutrality and Internet anonymity.

						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn"></a>LinkedIn sends "invite emails" to Outlook contacts from its members' email accounts, without obtaining their consent. The "invitations" give the impression that the e-mail holder himself has sent the invitation. If there is no response, the answer will be repeated several times ("You have not yet answered XY's invitation.") LinkedIn was sued in the United States on charges of hijacking e-mail accounts and spamming. The company argued with the right to freedom of expression. In addition, the users concerned would be supported in building a network. <br>At the end of 2013, it was announced that the LinkedIn app intercepted users' emails and silently moved them to LinkedIn servers for full access.<br>The German Stiftung Warentest has criticized that the allotment of rights between users and LinkedIn is disproportionate, restricting users' rights excessively while granting the company far-reaching rights. It has also been claimed that LinkedIn does not respond to consumer protection center requests</p>

						<p>Slogan: Bing is for doing<br> Bing is a web search engine owned and operated by Microsoft. The service has its origins in Microsoft's previous search engines: MSN Search, Windows Live Search and later Live Search. <br> Bing has been heavily advertised as a "decision engine",[66] though thought by columnist David Berkowitz to be more closely related to a web portal. <br> Bing Rewards was a loyalty program launched by Microsoft in September 2010. It was similar to two earlier services, SearchPerks! and Bing Cashback, which were subsequently discontinued.<br><br>
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bing_(search_engine)">Microsoft has been criticized for censoring Bing search results to queries made in simplified Chinese characters, used in mainland China. This is done to comply with the censorship requirements of the government in China. Microsoft has not indicated a willingness to stop censoring search results in simplified Chinese characters in the wake of Google's decision to do so.All simplified Chinese searches in Bing are censored regardless of the user's country.The English-language search results of Bing in China has been skewed to show more content from state-run media like Xinhua and China Daily<br>Bing has been criticized for being slower to index websites than Google. It has also been criticized for not indexing some websites at all. <br> Bing has been criticized by competitor Google for utilizing user input via Internet Explorer, the Bing Toolbar, or Suggested Sites, to add results to Bing.</a></p>

					<p>“Stairs are biased towards people who can walk, books are biased towards people who can see and even most programming languages are biased towards English speaking people... This is to say that technologies are not neutral, they are embedded with the biases of the folks who produced them.“</p> <h2>- Quote from Nick Britz’ website, “Net Art Rocks”</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="invisibilityCloak nfacts" id="f02">
					<p>An interactive and artistic exploration into the ideas surrounding digital literacy and net neutrality. Technology - whether small (such as a file extension) or big (such as the internet) - is never neutral, they are biased according to the person/people who produced them.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="invisibilityCloak nfacts" id="f03">
					<p>“I'd like to think that computers are neutral, a tool like any other... But there is something in the system itself, in the formal logic of programs and data, that recreates the world in its own image. [...]We think we are creating the system, but the system is also creating us. We build the system, we live in its midst, and we are changed.”</p><h2>- Excerpt from Close To The Machine, by Ellen Ullman</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="invisibilityCloak nfacts" id="f04">
					<p>The project concept is to create a visual representation of some of the most well recognised and used platforms on the internet, which, as the user interacts with them begin to reveal the complexities of each.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="invisibilityCloak nfacts" id="f05">
					<p>The complexities presented reveal the ‘hidden’ information about these online platforms: whether this in the form of representing who the creators are, where they are from (Eurocentric or Amerocentric biases?), their gender and race; what political stance the platform or creators hold; what the platform was intended for; what the platform tracks or knows about you; and possibly any contradictory or controversial information about said platform.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="invisibilityCloak nfacts" id="f06">
					<p>This begins to paint a complex world, one which questions - and asks the viewer to question - what the inherent biases of the internet are, what the agenda may be and whether or not this is harmful. The intention is to increase the audience’s sense of awareness on these issues, and thus, heighten digital literacy in terms of net neutrality.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="invisibilityCloak nfacts" id="f07">
					<p>As the parts swing, rotate and move the viewer is both in and out of control - physically experiencing the effects of the bias of me - the creator - as well as visually exploring the biases of the platforms presented.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="invisibilityCloak nfacts" id="f08">
					<p>Basically, the project is representing net neutrality and the inherent bias of all created platforms that we use online, by exploding the information relating to very popular user platforms onto a 3D map that the user needs to try to engage with.</p>
